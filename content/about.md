I'm Imari Joy C. Borda. Science Research Specialist at the Center for Applied Modeling, Data Analytics, and Bioinformatics for Decision Support Systems in Health. Freelance web developer specializing in full-stack development.

## Services

I dedicate myself with presenting my clients with complete projects that not only meet, but exceed their initial vision. Knowing what to expect when we work together is critical - here is how I deliver success:

- Consultation: It all begins with a conversation where we'll pinpoint what this project is all about.

- Proposal: A detailed project proposal including visual preview will be presented and a plan of action will be decided.

- Creation: Clients receive regular updates regarding their project status while I create and test it.

- Launch and Support: Peace of mind is delivered with the final project in the form of available ongoing support.
