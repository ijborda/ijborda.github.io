I’m a software engineer with 5+ years of experience building backend systems that are fast, reliable, and built to scale. I’ve got a math background, so I naturally lean toward clean algorithms, smart data models, and the occasional machine learning experiment.

While backend work is my main focus (high-throughput systems, microservices), I’ve also dabbled in a bit of everything: cloud stuff (mostly AWS), system architecture, testing, analytics, and machine learning. I enjoy learning and building things. It's also helped me see the bigger picture and understand how all the pieces fit together.

## Few Things

  - I studied Applied Math at UP Mindanao and graduated Magna Cum Laude in 2019 through the DOST-SEI scholarship. Got into courses like Advanced Calculus, Linear Algebra, Numerical Analysis, Operations Research, and Statistical Theory. For undergrad research, I've worked on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Also took on the role of chairperson for the Society of Math Majors - good times.

  - Most of my web programming skills are self-taught. I’ve made it a habit to study what I need, apply it, and continuously add to my toolkit, all so I can bring more value to the work I do. To further challenge and improve my skills, I joined a few competitive programming contests and pursued industry certifications.
