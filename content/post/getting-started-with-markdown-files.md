This is a material I created for an internal workshop on how to get started with markdown files. Here, the following was covered:

1. The relevance of markdown files;
2. Setting up the environment;
3. Basic syntax;
4. Basic git and GitHub for pushing markdown files to GitHub; and
5. Using GitHub Pages to generate a static website.

The material can be found [here](https://imarijoyborda.com/markdown-tutorial/).
