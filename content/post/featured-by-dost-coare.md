The [COARE (The Computing and Archiving Research Environment)](https://asti.dost.gov.ph/projects/coare/) is a High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Cloud facility that allows free access of its services to students, researchers, and data analysts. It is managed by the DOST ASTI (Department of Science and Technologu - Advanced Science and Technology Institute).

As part of the #SpotlightOnWomenInHPC (WHPC Ph) campaign, I was featured in their [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/coare.facility/photos/a.462036187312155/2074767766038981/). WHPC Ph is a social media campaign for Women in HPC Philippines initiative that aims to highlight the visibility of women working in HPC and advance networking. It aims to create a strong and reliable community for women in the field of HPC and advanced networking, where women can participate and feel empowered and valued.

‚ÄúHi! I am Imari, and I am a Science Research Specialist at the Center for Applied Modeling, Data Analytics, and Bioinformatics for Decision Support Systems in Health (AMDABiDSS-Health). I do research on mathematical modeling of epidemics, specifically phylodynamic modeling. Currently, our research center (AMDABiDSS-Health) is focused on modeling the CoVid-19. Here, we try to find the answer on how the virus spreads, how fast it is spreading, and where it is spreading using the viral genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2. This is quite an extensive methodology, and it requires high computational power, so we are using COARE‚Äôs HPC to do our modeling. The HPC is helpful because our runs would take a long time to complete. With the HPC, we are also allowed to have multiple runs at the same time which makes playing with the model and changing the parameters very easy. I really appreciate that DOST-ASTI offers COARE as part of its services.

My favorite moment in doing this research is when there are already tangible outputs of what we do, it is like a paper or a dashboard of the results. The feeling of seeing the outputs always makes me feel proud of how far we‚Äôve come. It also makes me excited because we can already share our findings with the public and with our stakeholders. I also like to talk about what I do, so being able to finally share our work is something I always look forward to.

Aside from this, I really enjoy mentoring high school and college students. I am fortunate enough that our research center has an internship program on related topics. Being able to share our expertise with the budding scientists and researchers and seeing what they were able to achieve from the internship gives us such fulfillment on our end.

When doing research, I always bear in mind who am I doing this for. Being aware of their needs and knowing how our work can potentially make an impact on them keeps me inspired to do my best and to continue innovating.

Research is difficult. There are many challenges in terms of figuring out the methodology, analyzing the results, and communicating your work to other people. However, it is also a good thing because we are constantly challenged to learn, improve, and innovate. Research empowers me to always exceed myself and to think outside the box. It is also more empowering because we are doing all of these for our country and for science. Knowing that this can eventually help many people really gives me the drive to do my best.

Aside from my research work, I am also a kind of person who likes to watch anime! I am a fan of One Piece, Naruto, Attack on Titan, and other series üòÅ ‚Äù
