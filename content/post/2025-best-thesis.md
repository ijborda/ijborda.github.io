It felt like a homecoming of sorts. This time, not as a student, but as one of the invited external judges for the 2025 Search for the Best Undergraduate Thesis in Applied Mathematics at the University of the Philippines Mindanao last 2025 June 30.

Hosted by the Department of Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science, the event highlighted some of the most promising student work across three major categories: Best Thesis, Best Poster, and the Three-Minute Thesis (3MT) competition. It was great to be surrounded again by the academic energy. With technical ideas being dissected, algorithms debated, models questioned. And to see students stepping up with solid research and bold questions.

The finalists tackled a wide range of topics, from AI-assisted fish identification to deep learning forecasts for rabies and dengue, to text mining for urban policy, all anchored in real-world problems and backed by solid math.

Group picture with the finalists below. I like that I can still blend in as a student :D.

Alongside Dr. Kenneth Barroga, PhD (Assistant Regional Director of the Department of Science and Technology Region XI) and and Mr. Ronald A. Gica, MSc (Special Science Teacher and Head of Mathematics Department at the Philippine Science High School Southern Mindanao Campus), I had the chance to review their work, listen to their pitches, and ask questions that hopefully helped them see their projects from new angles.

Itâ€™s easy to forget how much growth happens in these early research moments, and being part of this reminded me why I fell in love with applied math and building systems in the first place. Always good to be back in this circle, and still nerding out over ideas that matter.
