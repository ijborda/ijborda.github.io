Circa 2018, I joined CS50x Puzzle Day under the team name "Enigma". Our team was able to finish all the puzzles ðŸŽ‰. After the event ended, CS50 posted a [medium article](https://cs50.medium.com/this-was-cs50x-puzzle-day-2018-22d95a48615) as part of its culmination. Luckily few of the photos featured in the article were from our team. Search the article for photos "by Arun Kumar" to see them.
