## How To Use
Select a date and press `Submit`. NASA's APOD on that day and it's description will be shown. APOD for the latest day is available within 24 hours (maximum, depending on timezone). 

Users can also press `Random APOD` to generate APOD on a random date.

By default, the latest available APOD is shown (or the day before, depending on timezone).

Some APOD are in video format. In this case, videos are played automatically and in a loop without sounds.

## How It's Made
This uses [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov). Tech used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

## Future Improvements
There are still lots that need to be improved in this web application. Some plans are:
* Improve responsivenes
* Add links for social media sharing (twitter, facebook, etc.)
* Allow saving of image/video.

Contributions are also very welcome! Just issue a pull request.
